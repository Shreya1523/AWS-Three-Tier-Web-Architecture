# AWS-Three-Tier-Web-Architecture
This project implements a Three-Tier Architecture on AWS, consisting of a web server, application server, and an Amazon RDS database. The infrastructure is manually configured to ensure scalability, security, and high availability. It includes setting up VPC networking, subnets, security groups, and other essential AWS services like Elastic Load Balancer and Auto Scaling to support a robust and fully functional deployment.
